# Hi there, I'm Gabriel Ihloff 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me
<img align="right" width="150" src="./PortfolioPic.png" alt="Profile Photo" />

I am a **Machine Learning Student** at **Atlas School of Tulsa**, currently in my **4th Trimester (of 5)**. 

Since beginning my Machine Learning specialization in Trimester 3, I have focused on predictive modeling, data analysis, and Python-based data science tools. Unlike many data scientists, I started my journey with a rigorous **Full Stack Software Engineering** foundation. This unique combination allows me to not just build models, but understand the backend systems (C#, SQL) required to deploy and maintain them in production environments.

* **Primary Focus:** Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn).
* **Technical Foundation:** C, C# (.NET), SQL, JavaScript, React, Node.
* **Education:** Atlas School of Tulsa (Vocational Software Engineering).

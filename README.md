# Hi there, I'm Gabriel Ihloff 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me
<img align="right" width="150" src="./PortfolioPic.png" alt="Profile Photo" />

I am a **Machine Learning Student** at **Atlas School of Tulsa**, currently in my **4th Trimester (of 5)**.

My technical journey began at the **University of Oklahoma**, where I studied **Mechanical and Electrical Engineering**. This background provided me with a rigorous foundation in the advanced mathematics and systems logic required for Data Science. 

I pivoted to the tech industry to apply that logic to software. At Atlas, I spent my first two trimesters building a strong **Full Stack Software Engineering** foundation (C#, SQL, JavaScript) before specializing in Machine Learning in Trimester 3. 

This unique combination allows me to be a "hybrid" developer: I don't just build predictive models in a notebook; I understand the backend architecture required to deploy, integrate, and maintain them in production environments.

* **Primary Focus:** Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn).
* **Technical Foundation:** C, C# (.NET), SQL, JavaScript.
* **Education:** * **Atlas School of Tulsa** (Vocational Software Engineering)
    * **University of Oklahoma** (Coursework in Mechanical & Electrical Engineering)
